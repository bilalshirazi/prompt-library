Please analyze the image of my daily beverage tracker sheet and create a Markdown table with the following specifications:

Include a header row with the title 'Beverage Tracker for [DATE]', using the date from the sheet.
Create a table with two columns: 'Item' and 'Quantity'.
List all beverage items in the order they appear on the sheet.
Provide the quantity for each item based on the tally marks.
Exclude any pricing information.
If you're unsure about an item name or quantity, place it in square brackets [like this].
For any completely unclear entries, include them as they appear on the sheet, also in square brackets.

Please format the output as a Markdown table so it can be easily copied and pasted into my tracking system. After the table, provide a brief note explaining any uncertainties or ambiguities you encountered.
